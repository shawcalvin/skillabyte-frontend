                        <p className="mb-4">An agent in AI is a software entity designed to autonomously perform specific tasks, perceiving its environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve its goals. In a multi-agent system (MAS), agents are more than just promptsâ€”they operate independently, each with unique capabilities, roles, and objectives, often working collaboratively to achieve complex goals through dynamic interaction with their environment.</p>
                        <p className="mb-4">Unlike a static prompt-response model, agents adapt to changes, communicate, and fulfill distinct roles, accessing specialized tools or data sources. This allows them to share information, learn from experiences, and respond dynamically, making them far more effective and adaptable than simple prompts.</p>
